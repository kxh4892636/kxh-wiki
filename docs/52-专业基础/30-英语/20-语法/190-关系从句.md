# 关系从句

## 关系从句的构造

##### 构造机制

- 主句和从句有关系；
- 不添加额外连接词；
- 将重复元素改写为连接词；

##### 先行词

- 主句和从句有关系的重复元素，为名词；
- 根据重复元素在从句中的位置选择不同的关系代词；
- 关系代词用于修饰先行词；
- 若重复元素为人；
  - 关系代词：who，whom，whose；
- 若重复元素为物；
  - 关系代词：which，whose；
- 若具有指示功能且不在介词后；
  - 人和物关系代词皆可使用 that；

```json
// 先行词为 something
// 重复元素为 it, 改写为关系代词 which
I know something. Nobody else knows it.

## which 代替限定词

##### which 代替限定词

```json
// 重复元素为 that, 虽然为人, 但依旧使用 which

```

##### 主句为先行词

- 主句和从句逗哥隔开，关系代词使用 which；
- 先行词可能为整个主句；
- 句意模棱两可；

```json
// 先行词可能是 ants 也可能是整个主句
// 通过 was 得知是整个主句
The whole house was overrun with ants, which was rather weird.
// 通过 were 得知是 ants
The whole house was overrun with ants, which were rather weird.
```

##### 使用同位语

- 清晰句意；

```json
// sight 表明先行词为整个主句
The whole house was overrun with ants, a sight which frightened the visitor.
// insects 表明先行词为 ants
The whole house was overrun with ants, nasty insects which frightened the visitor.
```

## 指示功能

##### 指示功能

- 若关系从句具有指出哪一个的功能；
- 称其具有指示功能；
- 无指示功能的关系从句可有可无，一般使用 ，分隔；
- 无指示功能的关系从句只能使用 who 和 which 且不能省略；

```json
I met a friend who(that) went to the same high school with me.
// 可省略关系从句
I met Jack Wang, who went to the same high school with me.
```

##### that 的使用时机

- 缺乏指示功能不能使用 that，that 具有强烈的指示功能；
- 指示功能的常用场景；
  - 先行词是 all，anything 等具有明确范围的单词；
  - 先行词被 first，next，only 等限定词修饰；

```json
Thirty minutes is all the time that I can spare.
You are the only person that really understands me.
```

##### 关系代词何时不能省略

- 无指示功能时，关系代词不可省略；
- 逗号隔开，主句和从句自给自足；

## 关系从句的位置

##### 常见位置

- 关系从句作为形容词从句，修饰先行词；
- 通常放置于先行词后面；
- 但要视情况而定；

```json
I can' t leave a man behind. This man has done so much for my family.
// 不好, 主句结构清晰, 不知道 behind 属于主句还是从句
I can' t leave a man [who has done so much for my family] behind.
// 关系从句后移
I can' t leave a man behind, [who has done so much for my family].

I found a book in the library.The book focuses on social relations.
// 不好, 主句结构清晰, 不知道 library 属于主句还是从句
I found a book [which focuses on social relations] in the library.
// 不好, 主句结构清晰, 不知道先行词是 book 还是 library
I found a book in the library [which focuses on social relations].
