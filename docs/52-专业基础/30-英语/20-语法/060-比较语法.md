# 比较语法

## 大于, 小于, 等于

##### 大于

```json
// adj + than
Unit 3 is longer than Unit 4.
```

##### 小于

```json
//  less … than 或 not so … as
Unit 3 is less difficult than Unit 4.
Unit 3 is not so important as Unit 4.
```

##### 等于

```json
// as ... as
Unit 4 is as boring as Unit 3.

// 通过倍数表示大于和小于
Unit 4 is twice as difficult as Unit 3. // 大于
Unit 3 is half as difficult as Unit 4. // 小于
```

## 定冠词和代词

##### 定冠词

- 形容词修饰名词短语, 最高级加 the;
- 形容词作补语, 最高级不加 the;
- 如果具有指示性, 比较级也可以加 the;

```json
Yellowstone is most crowded in summer. // 修饰 Yellowstone 作补语, 不加 the
Yellowstone is the most crowded of the state's scenic spots. // 修饰 spots, 加 the
John is the shorter of the twins. // 特指 John, 加 the
```

##### 代词

```json
// that 和 those 代指重复的名词
Cars made in Japan are better than those made in Korea.
```

## 平行对称要求

##### 原则

- 比较的双方必须平行;
- 即比较对象, 人称等对等;

```json
Prices of papayas in Thailand are much lower than England. // Prices of papayas in Thailand 和 England 不对等, 错误
Prices of papayas in Thailand are much lower than those in England. // 修改为 those in England
```

##### 适用范围

```json
// 不限于比较级, 最高级, 凡是涉及比较, 都要遵循平行对称要求
Like Shakespeare, Keats' poetry is a true reflection of life. // Shakespeare 和 Keats' poetry 不对等
Like Shakespeare, Keats wrote poetry that is a true reflection of life.
```

## 比较句法的省略

##### 省略原则

- 以清楚为底线;
- 不能过度省略而导致句意模棱两可;

```json
These restaurateurs do more business with tourists than local farmers. // 句意模棱两可, 不知道比较对象
// restaurateurs 和 local farmers 比较
These restaurateurs do more business with tourists than local farmers do with tourists.
These restaurateurs do more business with tourists than local farmers do.
// local farmers 和 tourists 比较
These restaurateurs do more business with tourists than these restaurateurs do with local farmers.
These restaurateurs do more business with tourists than they do with local farmers.
These restaurateurs do more business with tourists than with local farmers.
```

## 比较点的观察

```json
Your friend is bolder than you // 比较 your friend 和 you, 比较点在 bolder, 使用比较级
Your friend is more bold than wise. // 比较 bold 和 wise 的程度, 比较点在程度, 不使用比较级
This movie is more boring than (it is) educational.
I regard John more as a brother than as a boyfriend. // 舔狗不得好死!!!
```
