# 简化子句

## 简化子句

##### 简化子句

- 复句省略重复的元素;

```json
// 未简化
I avoid [that I am caught] [when I am unprepared.]
// 简化
I avoid being caught unprepared.
```

## 子句简化的基本原则

##### 子句简化的基本概念

- 视 be 为动词, be 后面的现在分词, 过去分词, 不定式 ... 视为主语补语;
- 现在分词视为形容词, 具有持续, 进行的暗示;
- 过去分词视为形容词, 具有被动, 完成的暗示;
- 不定式短语具有不确定语气, 同对应的情态动词;
- 情态动词可以改写为 be to.

##### 子句简化的共同做法

- 省略相同主词, be 动词和无意义的连接词, 保留补语取代子句并转换为名词形式;
  - 若有 be 动词, 省略 be 动词;
  - 若有情态动词, 简化为 be to;
  - 若无 be 动词或情态动词, 动词使用现在分词形式;

```json
// 省略 be 动词
[While he was taking a bath], Archimedes discovered the principle of buoyancy.
While taking a bath, Archimedes discovered the principle of buoyancy.
// 简化情态动词
I expect [that I can finish the book on the way].
I expect [to finish the book on the way].
// 普通动词使用现在分词形式
The runner [who finished second] won a small prize.
The runner [finishing second] won a small prize.
```

## 关系从句简化

### 简化为分词

#### 现在分词

- 一般时: 移除连接词, 普通动词变为现在分词;
- 完成时: 移除连接词, have 变为现在分词;

```json
The man [who wants to see you] is waiting outside.
The man [wanting to see you] is waiting outside.

Anyone [that has visited Bali once] will want to return.
Anyone [having visited Bali once] will want to return.
```

#### 过去分词

- 一般时: 移除连接词, 普通动词保留原型;
- 完成时: 移除连接词, have 变为现在分词;

```json
Grapes [that are grown in the Champagne area] make the best wines.
// 移除连接词和 be 动词, grown 保留原型
Grapes [grown in the Champagne area] make the best wines.

A student [who has been trained at this school] is guaranteed to excel in any exam.
A student [having been trained at this school] is guaranteed to excel in any exam.
// 因为 trained 本身具有被动, 完成的意味, 可以省略 having been
A student [trained at this school] is guaranteed to excel in any exam.
```

### 简化为复合形容词

##### 复合现在分词

```json
 "Big John"  is a machine that drills tunnels.
// 省略 that, drills tunnels 构成复合形容词 tunnel-drilling
 "Big John"  is a tunnel-drilling machine.

That magazine which looks beautiful is for women.
That beautiful-looking magazine is for women.
```

##### 复合过去分词

```json
I love these high peaks, [which are covered with snow].
// 省略连接词和 be 动词, covered with snow 构成复合形容词 snow-covered
I love these high, snow-covered peaks.

These apples, [which were bitten by frost], are beginning to rot.
These frost-bitten apples are beginning to rot.
```

### 简化为形容词

- 关系从句为 S + V + C;
- 省略连接词和 be 动词;

```json
A chimpanzee is an animal [that is capable of reason].
A chimpanzee is an animal [capable of reason].

The boy, [who is usually tall and heavy for his age], wants to be a sumo wrestler.
The boy, [usually tall and heavy for his age], wants to be a sumo wrestler.
```

### 简化为名词

- 关系从句为 S + V + C;
- 省略连接词和 be 动词;

```json
The Great Wall of China, [which is the largest man-made structure on earth], no longer serves a military function.
The Great Wall of China, [the largest man-made structure on earth], no longer serves a military function.

This movie features Tom Hanks, [who is my favorite movie star].
This movie features Tom Hanks, [my favorite movie star].
```

### 简化为不定式

##### 前提

- 关系从句动词短语具有情态动词;
- 省略连接词和主语;
- 情态动词转换为不定式;

```json
This is not the right thing [which you should do].
// , should do 变为 to do
This is not the right thing [to do].

If you want a loan, our manager is the person [whom you should see].
If you want a loan, our manager is the person [to see].
```

##### 不定式的语态

```json
// 主动态
There' s still one more person [whom we must notify].
There' s still one more person to notify.

// 被动态
There' s still one more person [who must be notified].
There is one more person to be notified
```

##### 主动和被动的适用场景

- 连贯性: 保持主句和分句主语一致;

```json
// 主句和分句主语不一致, 不好
When John stepped into his office, the boss was seen waiting there by him.
// 主句和分句主语一致, 好
When John stepped into his office, he saw the boss waiting there.
// 简化
Stepping into his office, John saw the boss waiting there.
```

##### 主词不一致

- 保留主词, 使用 for;

```json
I' m looking for a motorcycle [that my wife can ride].
I' m looking for a motorcycle [for my wife to ride].
```
