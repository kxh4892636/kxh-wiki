# 语态

## 基础

### 表现形式

### 被动态的限制

##### 连贯性

- 修改被动态后保持连贯性;

```json
// 前后从句主语不一致, 不推荐使用被动态

// 主动态更好

```

##### 清楚性

```json
// 改为被动态后句意更加清楚, 不使用 someone, they 这种含糊不清的主语
Someone stole my wallet.

```

##### 简洁性

```json
// 使用被动态使从句主语一致, 进而简化
Because the nurse told him to wait outside, the man found a chair and sat down.

Told to wait outside, the man found a chair and sat down.
